These files highlight some of my scripts used for Microbiome data analysis. I have attached an example HTML file to show how my data analysis can be visualized using R Markdown, while the .R scripts show how my scripts and data analysis are organized normally. 

In short, these scripts entail data import, data tidying, and data visualization. I use statistical verification such as t tests and wilcoxin tests to determine if differences between my data are significant or not, and I generate outputs for visualization using other software as well. Common visualization graphs I produce in this script include rarefaction curves, venn diagrams, stacked bar plots, box plots, and more.

Feel free to let me know if there is anything I can do to improve my workflow and make my coding more efficient, I am eager to learn!
