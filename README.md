These files highlight some of my scripts used for Microbiome data analysis. I have attached an example HTML file to show how my data analysis can be visualized using R Markdown, while the .R script shows how the script and data analysis is organized normally. Feel free to let me know if there is anything I can do to improve my workflow and make my coding more efficient, I am eager to learn!
